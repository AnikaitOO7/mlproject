setup
1. create a git hub repository
2. create new virtual environment = [ conda create -p mlvenv python==3.8 -y] (-y is for the approval)
3. activate environment = [conda activate mlvenv/] 
4. clone repository and sync with the git hub
    git init
    create a readme.md file and then
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/AnikaitOO7/mlproject.git
    git push -u origin main
5. create a .gitignore file in the github and select python templete ()
6. create setup.py(to create in python package in pypi(building application as package itself)) file and requirements.txt
7. create src directory (complete development take place in this folder) and in it create  __init__.py (In Python, the __init__.py file is used to mark a directory as a Python package) file for the find_packages() to build so that internal folder also work as package
8. (-e .)(editable mode) in requirements.txt to automatically trigger setup.py 
9. pip install requirements.txt in the end -e . trigger setup to build package which has the meta data of the project


Project Structure / Exception handling

1. in src create components (modules that we will use in our project) folder and in component folder create __init__.py which then can be created as package and can be imported in other file location
2. then create data_ingestion.py for reading data from the data base in train and test 
3. then create data_transformation.py file for transforming data from category feature into numerical feature and how to handle one hot encoding and how to handle label encoding
4. then create model_trainer.py for training model (confussion matrix to classification and if regression may use r square , adjusted r square value)
5. then create the pipeline folder for training and prediction pipeline in train_pipeline.py and other predict_pipeline.py and at last also create __init__.py file
6. in src create three more file for logger.py for logs , exception.py for handling exception and utlis.py for creating function that will be use in entire application
